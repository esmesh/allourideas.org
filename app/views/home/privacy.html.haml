%h3 Overview

%p SciSPIF is a research project lead by #{link_to "Erika S. Mesh", "http://people.rit.edu/esm1884/"} of #{link_to "Rochester Institute of Technology.", "http://www.rit.edu/"} under the guidance of #{link_to "Dr. J. Scott Hawker", "http://www.se.rit.edu/~hawker/"}.  As such, all of our data collection and processing procedures have been approved by the #{link_to "RIT's Human Subject Research Office Institutional Review Board (HSRO IRB)", "https://www.rit.edu/research/hsro/"}.  Also, all members of our research team who have access to the data have completed TODO CERTIFICATION INFORMATION.  In other words, we take data protection very seriously.

%p Because this is a research project, we need to collect data from the site.  We are interested in broad, aggregate patterns in the data, not in how any one particular person voted.  So, for example, we are interested in the average prefences of different subsets of the respondants (e.g. students vs. faculty), but we are not interested in which student prefers X over Y.

%p Below, we have information to some more specific questions, written in legalize.  When in doubt, you can always email us or check out #{link_to "our code", "http://github.com/allourideas"}; this project is entirely open source.

%h3 What information do we collect?

%p We collect information from you when you interact with SciSPIF.

%p TODO When creating a question, you will be required to enter your email address. You may, however, vote on questions anonymously. All visitors to the site will have their IP address #{link_to "geolocated", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geolocation"} using a publicly available database.  We store your approximate location, as inferred from your IP address, and a #{link_to "cryptographic hash", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_hash_function"} of your IP address in our database.  We do not store IP addresses in our database.  We also use third-party analytics services, such as #{link_to "Google Analytics", "http://www.google.com/analytics/"}, to track traffic on the website.
